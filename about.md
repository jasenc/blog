### Hi, I'm Jasen Carroll.
I've graduated college with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering; worked for a top performing S&P 500 company for over two years; went from the Consumer industry to Medical Devices; lived a few places along the way; and now have decided to focus my career on web development.

I'm learning as I go and that's what this blog will be all about, hope you stay tuned. Feel free to email me, check out my [Github](https://github.com/jasenc) repositories, or look over my portfolio to see what I else I've been up to.
