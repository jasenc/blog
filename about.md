### Hi, I'm Jasen Carroll.
I've graduated college with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, worked for a top performing S&P 500 company for over two years, went from the Consumer industry to Medical Devices, lived a few places along the way, and now have decided to focus my career on web development.

I'm learning as I go and that's what this blog will be all about, hope you stay tuned. Feel free to email me or check out my [Github](https://github.com/jasenc) repositories to see what I'm up to along the way. One day I'll have a portfolio together to show off some of my private projects too.
