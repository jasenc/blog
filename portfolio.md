### jQuery Note Taking App
***

After making sure I could build and understand responsive HTML & CSS sites without libraries I moved directly on to jQuery and built this fun little project. It's a single page that focuses a lot on DOM manipulation to give the experience of interacting with an application. It can even accept inline HTML to help style the input.

Future plans include connecting to a database, adding a user interface, creating an auto updating table of tags, and maybe even a mobile app for interactions from the phone.

### Val Teams
***

After working in the industry of FDA Validations for a few years I noticed some things. These validation projects can be very resource intensive at the start but tend to trickle off at the end. As a result there is a sustainable lifestyle in being a validation consultant. Recruiters are constantly searching for people to fill their positions.

I wanted to create a simple and effective site that would allow consultants to connect with recruiters as well as the other way around. Recruiters and consultants both load up their profile with the type of validations they work with, they get matched together, and can sign up for a paid account to unlock contact information.

The site is done using Ruby on Rails and takes advantage of some Bootstrap styles.
