I feel like I've wasted some time throughout the months without having clear cut goals and testing out a lot of resources and tools because I like shiny new things. At this point I'm starting to finally build some much needed confidence as well as understand all of the various platforms and what their uses and benefits are for. On top of that I'm seeing how my programming skills from college haven't been entirely lost through the years now that I'm slowly starting to dabble with the Back End technologies.

But enough about me, here is my suggestion for how you should learn web development, get a glimpse of everything, do some front end, and then go to the back:

* [Code Academy](http://codecademy.com) - A great resource for getting comfortable with a lot of technologies rather quickly. They just released a tracks program and I suggest you pick one and work through it all (preferably full stack of course). Keep in mind this is just scratching the surface of it all.
* [Hack Design](http://hackdesign.org) - 50 emails over 50 weeks of design principles. A few movies, a few games, a few frustratingly long articles. Start this when you start your Code Academy, make it a goal to get yourself on the market full stack when you get that 50th email.
* [Atlassian Git Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository) - Git is a version control software that makes managing your workflow incredible. Also, if you haven't already, sign up for a [Github](https://github.com/) account while you work through these tutorials.
* [Shay Howe's HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/) - Start this after completing Code Academy. Only do a few chapters at a time and make sure they sink in. Don't just copy his code, and don't just open his book on a second monitor while you mindlessly stare at his example code and type it in to your text editor on the other screen. (Trust me, you'll learn nothing.) Play around with his CodePen's, customize the site he has you build to make it your own and more interesting.
* Your First Project - Now you know enough to make a beautiful static website from scratch. If you don't have any ideas ask your friends and family if they have any website's they have always wanted. You'd be surprised the amount of people who still want something very simple to represent their business or hobby. Extra Credit: learn Sass along the way.
* Your Second Project - Make a simple application using jQuery. This should be a very fun and addictive experiment. Look at Bootstrap if you want a break from CSS for the time being and go back to Code Academy if you need a refresher. Make sure you [refactor that code](http://viget.com/inspire/simple-jquery-refactoring).

That's where I'm at so I can't give you much advice beyond that.
