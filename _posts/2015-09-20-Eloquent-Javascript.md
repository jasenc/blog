As promised...

I'm about to start working through [Eloquent JavaScript][1]. I decided to do so by
creating a [repo on GitHub][2]. I'll be creating a new `.js` file for each
chapter and project in the book. I plan on working through these problems using
[Node][3] so I can gain some familiarity with server side JavaScript before actually
implementing some on my own.

Another valuable resource I've found lately is [Front-End Fundamentals][4].
