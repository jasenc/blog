Well, today was the first day that I really got in to the Full Stack Nanodegree and I have to say that I am definitely pleased so far.

They start you off with foundations for Python picking up at functions and classes. It's always nice hearing someone else explain something that you already know. Even if you don't learn something new each time the repetition really helps get everything to sink in.

One of the first programs that you build is actually very practical. They dress it up as a secret message decoder, but really what it does is rename your file names by translating characters and/or deleting them. It's something that is very simple after you see it done, but if someone would have turned to me a few hours ago and asked me to come up with a Python script that reformats file names I would have looked back at them with a blank stare. It's also probably something that I never would have thought to attempt on my own.

Maybe I will use it to batch process my files with spaces in them so I can more easily access everything from the terminal.

By the way...

* I am hoping to start a (somewhat) daily post moving forward to just recap whatever I learned through the day.

* I want to add a search feature to my blog.

* I want to fix that pagination so that the user doesn't have to keep endlessly clicking if they want to get to the beginning (and fix those awkward looking buttons).

* I want to find a way to determine how many people have registered to my RSS feed, as well as get in to general website optimization. Though I doubt there is much to optimize with this site, I could be proven wrong.
