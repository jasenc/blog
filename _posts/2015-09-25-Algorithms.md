If you were following me on [GitHub][1] you'd see that I also started working on
the [Algorithms][2] class delivered by [Khan Academy][3] and taught by professors
over at [Dartmouth][4].

Instead of following along with the classes online JavaScript compiler I
decided to work locally. I also decided that I am already doing enough
work in JavaScript and would rather a scripting language. I have
done more work in Python thanks to the Udacity courses I took, however, I am
noticing that the trend around Portland is to work with Ruby - and Rails. Taking
that in to account I have decided to [work through these algorithms using Ruby][5].

It'll be nice to continue exploring all three languages at the same time as I
should quickly be able to determine which one I prefer the most, and which
one I prefer the least...
