I completed and graduated from [Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree][1] in two months
time! I learned a lot along the way and I can't recommend the program enough.
The code reviews are incredibly valuable and each one of them provided
additional learning and feedback I wouldn't have received otherwise.

I originally intended on reviewing each project here on my blog. Though as can
be seen by the first review, they would turn out rather long and time consuming.
I'll end with saying that I learned A LOT about things I wouldn't have
necessarily spent the time to learn on my own. I found that I enjoy working with
databases, which is something I may have never realized if I wasn't pushed to
explore them so deeply. I also had a great time configuring my own
server and look forward to doing so again. With tools like Heroku available
these days, who knows when I would have explored server work on my own.
