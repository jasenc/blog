I've completed approximately 25% of Kahn Academy's course. However,
it became obvious that the material is only based on theory and getting
the algorithms to functionally work.

As a result I am switching gears ever so slightly back to Udacity where
I am taking their [CS-215 Intro to Algorithms][1]. The course provides
plenty of real world examples as well as about eight different problem sets to
work though. Keep an eye out for the problem sets on my GitHub.
