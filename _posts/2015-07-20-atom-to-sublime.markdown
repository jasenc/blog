I was a really big fan of [Atom](http://atom.io), and still am actually. But unfortunately I had to put it away for a while. The thing is it would start up fine but then would get very laggy after about 30 seconds. To the point where it couldn't keep up with me typing. After a week or so of trying to work around it and trouble shoot it on my own, including running in `atom --safe` and even deleting `~/.atom`, I needed something that would keep up. 

I had messed around with [Brackets](http://brackets.io) before but for some reason I really don't like it. I can't really put my finger on it. With that said there really are some great features to the program, like a keyboard shortcut that brings up contextual help for CSS selectors and attributes. 

I ended up with [Sublime](http://sublimetext.com), which I honestly am not too thrilled about. I really liked the community of Atom and it felt nice being apart of it. Either way Sublime will be the best back up I can use in the meantime with all of it's glorious features and what not. Who knows, maybe I'll end up sticking with it after I get through this [entire artcile](http://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/intro.html) on how to use everything.

If you're curious I went with the [bittersweet theme](https://github.com/nhat-nguyen/bittersweet) to make Sublime look beautiful.

Tomorrow starts my first day of class for my Full Stack Nanodegree. I am getting excited and after looking at the first project it seems like they really only teach you the back end, which is awesome because I can make the front end exactly however I want to design it to be!

So on and so forth.
