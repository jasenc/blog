## Python

* You can think of Classes as blueprints, templates, starting points, a shell to add more things to, the bare bones of what you want to do. They are essentially directories of previously written functions and/or the structure for an object.
* Python - as well as Ruby and other programming languages, all to different extents - comes with a bunch of previously written programs.
* We call those programs Classes.
* These Classes have with a bunch of handy functions.
* We call those functions Methods.
* You can write your own Classes, and they don't need to be in a separate file, nor do they necessarily have to have their own methods.
