I'm not necessarily a fan of [Hacker Rank][1].

Don't take that the wrong way. They have a great platform, it's a wonderful
learning tool, and new challenges are being added everyday. I've even found,
now that I am looking for a job, a lot of companies are starting to use it
for talent searching and screening. That also speaks to how nice of a platform
Hacker Rank has. My issues are from a usability standpoint, there is much to be
desired.

For starters, once you get to slightly more complex problems there is a lot of
reading involved. The layout that has been chosen is not very effective
towards learning a new problem as well as working through it. There is a lot
of scrolling involved is all I am saying. As a work around I've started taking
notes on paper. If you have enough screen real estate you could open a
second window with the same problem.

Secondly, and this one is a bit more irritating, is how inputs are handled.
Typically it seems that you have to capture one input that will tell you more
about the second input. However, these inputs are all strings so you have to
manipulate the data to be the format needed for how you want to solve the
problem. I get it. This is an good skill to have, data manipulation is
important. However, it takes away from the experience of developing algorithms
or learning other aspects of the language, or whatever other reason you are
using Hacker Rank for.

[Code Wars][2] defines a function for you and tests your solution by passing
different arguments through that function. They also have a side by side layout
as opposed to Hacker Rank's top down layout. A nice alternative for when you
need a break from Hack Rank's complexity.
