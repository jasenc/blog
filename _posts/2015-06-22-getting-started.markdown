Now I finally get to use [Mou](http://25.io/mou/).

Ok, so for the past month or so I've been trying to determine how I can have a fun blog that isn't a ton of work to maintain, preferably utilizes Markdown, and if I could eliminate having to deal with a web host that would be great too.

Luckily through some aimless Google searching for different matters I stumbled upon [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Though I've been using Github since I started my development cirriculum a few months ago, Pages is all new to me as well as this awesome blogging software [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Right now I'm rolling with a mostly vanilla build of the new theme for Jekyll 2.0. I've stripped out Twitter and thanks to [Nick Balestra](http://nick.balestra.ch/) and his Kactus theme added a beautiful call to action for users to subscribe to my blog via RSS.

A few other thing's I found on my late Sunday night Google-athon:

* [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) let's you host private repositories, free.
* [Divshot](https://divshot.com/) is a static web hosting service, free. Similar to this GitHub Pages, also like a front-end only version of [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).
* Smashing Magazine has a [great article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) if you're interesting in making one these for yourself. It also walks you through how to avoid install Ruby, Gems, and even Jekyll on your computer.

One last thing I'm going to mention is I recently switched over to [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/), aside from it's abundance of developer tools it also has a sweet dark theme. (And yes, that means it has dark themed tools!)
