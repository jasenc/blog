Well, I finished my Rails SAAS (Software As A Service). If anyone wants to take a gander you can see it live [here](https://shielded-everglades-6566.herokuapp.com) - be patient, it's probably sleeping. Full disclosure I found this awesome deal for [Coder Manual](https://stacksocial.com/sales/complete-job-ready-developer-course) and followed along. However I ran the newest software and developed locally in [Atom](http://atom.io/) as opposed to Rob Day's approach of using online IDEs, makes sense from an instructors stand point though.

This is about the time that I would tell you I am starting Eloquent JavaScript like I said I was going to, and Coder Manual says to.

Instead I want to know how it all works from the inside out instead of the other way around. I'm going to sign up for the [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004). I have the prerequisites down or I know where to find them. The major draw to this program is that they teach you how to build all of the server side code and how to host http using nothing but Python. Aside from the content, which can all be perused for free, what you're paying for is feedback. Instructors review your code and tell you where to improve.

Ultimately I've decided Python is probably just a better fit for me. I like that there is one correct way to do things instead of multiple options. I also like that it's used more in the science and data fields. Mmm, science. In case you haven't noticed [bento](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004), curated from developers at Stack Overflow, also has a greater focus on Python.

For anyone wondering Ruby vs Python or Rails vs Django you can check out this [article](https://www.coursereport.com/resources/ruby-on-rails-vs-python-and-django-which-should-a-beginner-learn). And for anyone wanting a full explanation of LAMP vs MEAN vs Rails check out this [article as well](https://www.coursereport.com/resources/lamp-stack-vs-mean-stack-vs-ruby-on-rails).

It'll be interesting to see how the job market and industry demand continues to change as I focus on this program. It would be nice to work on Eloquent JavaScript alongside this program, but we'll have to see if I have the time.

Hopefully my next post will be about how I am going to manage my resources moving forward.
