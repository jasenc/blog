I had previously set up my computer for Ruby and Rails. I went to use them again and somehow was back to Ruby 2.0 and no Rails to be found. Puzzled I simply reinstalled everything. I noticed the real trouble when I tried opening a new terminal window and could run a rails server. I checked all of my versions and somehow was back to Ruby 2.0 and no Rails to be found.

Frustrated, I had no idea how to trouble shoot this. Google "disappearing Rails"? With the limited knowledge I had and whatever I did find on the internet I concluded it was my terminal bash and/or shell. I remember previously tinkering with those files so I decided to delete _bash and try a reboot. (Thinking maybe if I was lucky the system would auto reinstall with default values - NOPE.)
